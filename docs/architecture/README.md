# Architecture Guidelines

## Design Principles

### 1. Scalability First
- Design systems to handle 10x current load
- Use horizontal scaling patterns
- Implement auto-scaling mechanisms
- Plan for data growth and user expansion

### 2. Fault Tolerance
- Assume components will fail
- Implement circuit breakers
- Use redundancy and replication
- Design for graceful degradation

### 3. Data Quality
- Validate data at ingestion
- Implement schema evolution
- Monitor data freshness and completeness
- Establish data lineage tracking

### 4. Security by Design
- Encrypt data at rest and in transit
- Implement proper access controls
- Regular security audits
- Data masking and anonymization

## Common Patterns

### Lambda Architecture
```
Batch Layer → Master Dataset → Batch Views
Speed Layer → Real-time Views → Serving Layer
Data Sources → Both Layers
```

### Kappa Architecture
```
Data Sources → Stream Processing → Serving Layer
             ↓
         Replayable Stream
```

### Microservices Pattern
- Single responsibility principle
- Independent deployment
- Service mesh for communication
- Centralized logging and monitoring

## Technology Stack Decisions

### Streaming vs Batch
- **Use Streaming**: Real-time requirements, event-driven
- **Use Batch**: Large historical processing, cost-sensitive
- **Use Both**: Lambda architecture for comprehensive coverage

### Database Selection
- **OLTP**: PostgreSQL, MySQL for transactions
- **OLAP**: Redshift, BigQuery for analytics
- **NoSQL**: MongoDB, Cassandra for flexible schemas
- **Cache**: Redis, Memcached for performance

### Cloud Provider Choice
- **AWS**: Mature services, strong data tools
- **Azure**: Enterprise integration, hybrid cloud
- **GCP**: Advanced ML/AI capabilities, BigQuery
- **Multi-cloud**: Avoid vendor lock-in, best-of-breed
